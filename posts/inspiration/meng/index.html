        <p>This poem are selected from &lsquo;the story of songs&rsquo; which is written in about 300 AC, almost the same time with &lsquo;the art of war&rsquo; which is more famous than the former.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration<a href="#inspiration" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The reason I translate this is I read an article (Why Women Sometimes Give Up On Men They Love)[https://psiloveyou.xyz/why-women-will-leave-men-they-love-a320d1e33c44]
It remind me of a love story almost 2000 years ago in a totally diffirent culture.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at this story.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-one">Chapter One<a href="#chapter-one" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>A man looks attractive comes to me,
use his cloth to swap my silk.</p>
<p>But he doesn&rsquo;t want the silk,
his target is me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to accompany with him to the River Qi when we seperate,
but we finally arrived at Hill Dunqu.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to delay our marriage inside my heart,
but you(the man) never make a formal propose.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t be angry,
I promise you autumn is the time.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-two">Chapter Two<a href="#chapter-two" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I miss you so sick,
I stand in the city wall to look for you,
I can feel my smile so bright when I find you,
I can also feel my pain if you don&rsquo;t appear.</p>
<p>You ask for fortune-teller to divine our future, It&rsquo;s bright,
so I enter your carriage and get married without doubt.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-three">Chapter Three<a href="#chapter-three" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>When the leaf of mulbery hasn&rsquo;t withered,
it looks colorful.
(When I&rsquo;m still young, I looks beautiful.)</p>
<p>Turtledove, don&rsquo;t eat too much mulbery fruit.
Gril, don&rsquo;t fall too deep in love.
(Chinese myth says the turtledove will get poisoning when it eats too much mulbery fruit)</p>
<p>If a man fall in love, he can still leave,
if a woman fall in love, she will get trapped.
(In the traditional society, if a woman has married with someone, she is really hard to remarry with someone else when divorced, the man is totally different)</p>
<h2 id="chapter-four">Chapter Four<a href="#chapter-four" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Now the leafs of mulbery has withered,
they fall down from the limb.</p>
<p>Since I came to your family,
my life became poor.</p>
<p>River Qi runs day and night,
it wets the curtain of my carriage (when I decide to leave you).</p>
<p>I have no fault in my behavior,
but you are inconsistent.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-five">Chapter Five<a href="#chapter-five" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>After I become your wife, I work hard for our family;
I go to bed late, I wake up early.</p>
<p>(However, we often have conflict.)
Since the verbally abusive ends,
the family violence starts.</p>
<p>Brothers are not wise enough,
laugh loudly at me.</p>
<p>I stay alone and calm down to consider about myself,
how sad I am!</p>
<h3 id="chapter-six">Chapter Six<a href="#chapter-six" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>River Qi looks so board, but it still has its border.
Swamp Xi looks so large, but it also has its end.
(so do I.)</p>
<p>I still remember my warm family time
when I&rsquo;m a little girl.</p>
<p>Even though once we own the swear and promise from each other,
we stand in different sides now,
I will never think about you again,
it&rsquo;s end.</p>
<h3 id="mordern-situation">mordern situation<a href="#mordern-situation" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The lucky part is nowadays, we can easily devorce without to much limit,
especially in the western society.(Asian countries are usually much traditional.)
However, marriage is a serious topic, not only about outlooking, money,
the same story happens everyday.</p>
<p>When I read the article before,
I can feel her pain.
But my opinion is don&rsquo;t give your husband/wife advice to listen to you, or try to change his personality.
Instead, find someone really cares about you,
natually he will talk and listen to you, about dreams, future.</p>
